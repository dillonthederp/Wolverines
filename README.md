Project abstract: 
Fracking has been a subject of controversy since its inception. In this project, we investigate the correlations and 
causations of earthquakes with regard to the recent increases in fracking activity. Throughout the project, we search
numerous datasets for the features required in order to formulate useful and sound conclusions regarding the use of 
fracking in the mid-western region. We make observations and predictions
of earthquake activity as it relates to fracking wells being drilled and operating. In order to make the observations,
we use data provided by various organizations dedicated to researching this topic. By representing this data in maps, 
plots, and other visualizations, we obtain a coherent picture of the story that the data presents. After studying the
data, we then formulate conclusions and make small predictions regarding future earthquake locations, intensity, and 
density.
